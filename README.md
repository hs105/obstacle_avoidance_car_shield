An Arduino controlled RC car with L298N. [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySksmX-fhQY)

## Parts
Arduino I bought from Amazon. All the other parts were from Ebay.  
* Chasis
* [L298N]
* [Arduino]
* [two 18650 batteries], 18650 battery box
* SR04 with holder
* 10cm female to male wires. Also used a few wires from Arduino starter package. 
* Servo SG90
* An on/off switch 


## Todo 
Hardware (add step by step)
* Use blue tooth chip to send data to computer python to matplot. this is easy for debugging. 
* A camera module to detect curve on the ground.
* A lidar sensor 

* Let the car follow lane
* Let the car can bypass another car, avoid collison, route plannnig.
